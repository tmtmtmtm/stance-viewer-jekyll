  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>This is a simple demo site for <b>Stancer</b> — a tool built on top
  of <b>VoteIt</b> to allow you to display how politicians and political
  groups voted on Issues like 
  <a href="/issue/PW-1050.html">banning fox hunting</a>, 
  <a href="/issue/PW-6670.html">reducing spending on welfare benefits</a>,
  <a href="/issue/PW-6686.html">allowing same-sex marriage</a>, or 
  <a href="/issue/PW-6685.html">introducing a bankers' bonus tax</a>.</p>

  <p>Although based on real data from the UK, it's only a demo, so
  don't rely on it for anything!</p>

  <p>The tools used to build this are designed to make it easy
  to build similar sites all around the world. So if you'd like to see
  something like this for <i>your</i> country, contact me:</p>
